Hey, cool topic!  Synthetic data can be a game-changer for rare event modeling.  The problem is, you often don't have enough real data to train a good model, especially for rare events. Synthetic data fills that gap.  It's basically fake data generated to mimic the patterns and characteristics of your real data, but with more instances of those rare events.  This lets you train your model with a much larger, more representative dataset.  

One common technique is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).  It creates synthetic instances by interpolating between existing minority class samples. 

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
```

This gives you more data points for the rare events, so your model can learn their patterns better. 

The real key is finding a way to generate synthetic data that accurately reflects the underlying distribution of the real data. Search "synthetic data generation" and you'll find lots of methods, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs).
