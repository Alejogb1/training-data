So, cross-lingual transfer learning is super cool. It's all about using knowledge from one language to help you learn another. Imagine you're trying to teach a computer to understand French. You could give it a ton of French text, but it might take forever. Instead, you could use a massive English dataset and use that to help it learn French faster. It's like giving it a head start. 

A common technique is to use pre-trained multilingual models. They're trained on a bunch of languages, so they already have some understanding of how languages work. For example, the "mBART" model can translate between many languages. You can use it to create a translation dataset, which can then be used to fine-tune a model for your specific task.

Here's a code snippet you can use:

```python
from transformers import MBartForConditionalGeneration, MBartTokenizer

model_name = "facebook/mbart-large-cc25"  # This is the name of the mBART model
tokenizer = MBartTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = MBartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

You can then use this model to translate text, and you can even fine-tune it for your specific task.

"mBART" "cross-lingual transfer learning"  "pre-trained multilingual models" "fine-tuning"
