Hey so I've been messing around with this class labeling thing where regions overlap and it's kinda tricky  I tried using a simple approach, like just picking the label with the highest confidence score in the overlapping areas  But that wasn't ideal, especially when you have multiple strong labels. 

I ended up finding this thing called "**weighted average**" that seemed to work better  Basically, you give each label a weight based on its confidence score and then average them together. It's like a voting system but each vote counts more if the label is more confident  Here's a little code snippet to illustrate:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming you have confidence scores for different labels in overlapping regions
confidence_scores = np.array([0.8, 0.6, 0.4])

# Calculate the weights for each label
weights = confidence_scores / np.sum(confidence_scores)

# Get the weighted average label
weighted_label = np.dot(weights, range(len(confidence_scores))) 
```

This is just a basic example, but you could adjust it to your specific needs  You can find more info on **weighted average** and **confidence scores** in image segmentation, it's a pretty common technique  Let me know if you're working on something similar, I'd be happy to chat more!
