Hey, that's super cool! Labeled corpora are essential for training models, especially for low-resource languages. I'm always on the lookout for resources like that. 

Can you give me some more details on the corpus? Like, which language(s) are covered? What types of labels are used? And how can I access it?

I'm particularly interested in datasets that use **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** or **Text Classification** labels. It would be awesome if it's publicly available, maybe on **Hugging Face** or **GitHub**.

If you have a code snippet to show how to access and load the data, I'd love to see it! 

Something like this would be great:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("my_low_resource_corpus", split="train")
```

Let me know if you have any other details! ðŸ˜Š
