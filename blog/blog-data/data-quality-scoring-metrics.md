Hey, data quality is super important right?  It's like the foundation of any data-driven decision.  To assess it, we need metrics, right?  There are tons of them, but here are a few I use all the time:

* **Completeness**:  This measures how many values are missing, you know, blank spaces. You can calculate it as:  `(Number of non-missing values) / (Total number of values)`
* **Accuracy**:  This checks if the data is correct, no typos, wrong formats, or anything like that.  You can use a formula like this: `(Number of accurate values) / (Total number of values)`
* **Consistency**:  Are all the values consistent, like same units, formats, etc.  This can be tricky, but you can use things like checksums or data validation rules. 

I usually use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to do this stuff, they're super handy for data manipulation and calculations.  You can easily calculate completeness and accuracy using them. 

For consistency, you'll need to write some custom code or use a library that handles data validation rules.  

Just remember, data quality is a journey, not a destination, so keep on improving it.  Good luck!
