Hey, that's a really cool area to explore! Labeled datasets are the backbone of any multilingual system. It's like giving your AI a cheat sheet, so it knows what things mean in different languages.

For example, you could use a dataset like "Multilingual Parallel Corpus" which pairs texts in multiple languages. It's super helpful for machine translation!

Here's a snippet showing how to load a dataset:

```python
import datasets

dataset = datasets.load_dataset("wmt14", "en-fr")
print(dataset)
```

This code uses the `datasets` library to load the "WMT14" dataset. It's specifically for English-French translation, but there are tons of other languages and tasks! You can search for datasets on [Hugging Face](search term: "Hugging Face Datasets") which has a great collection.

It's definitely a growing field, so keep an eye out for new datasets and techniques!
