Feature engineering is super important in time-series data, it's like the secret sauce for better predictions. Basically, you create new features from existing ones to give your model more information. 

Here's a simple example with Python and Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample time-series data
data = pd.DataFrame({'value': [10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32]})

# Create a new feature: rolling average
data['rolling_mean'] = data['value'].rolling(window=3).mean()

# Create a new feature: lagged value
data['lagged_value'] = data['value'].shift(1)

print(data)
```

This code creates a new feature called `rolling_mean` which is the average of the last 3 values. You can also add `lagged_value` which is the value from the previous time step. 

There are tons of other techniques like:

* **Trend and seasonality:** You can extract trend and seasonal patterns.
* **Domain knowledge:** Use your knowledge of the data to create custom features.
* **Time-based features:** Day of week, hour, month, etc.

The key is to experiment and see what features work best for your specific problem. You can use different feature engineering techniques and evaluate their impact on your model performance.
