Hey, OCR data preprocessing is super important for getting accurate results from your OCR engine. Basically, you're cleaning up the image before you try to read the text. There are a few key steps you can take:

1. **Image Enhancement** - This includes things like sharpening, contrast adjustment, and noise reduction.  You can do this with libraries like OpenCV in Python.

```python
import cv2
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
enhanced_img = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored(img, None, 10, 10, 7, 21) 
```

2. **Skew Correction** -  If the text is tilted, you need to straighten it out. There are algorithms like Hough Transform and  projection profile analysis you can use for this.

3. **Binarization** - Converting the image to black and white makes it easier for the OCR engine to recognize characters. You can use thresholding techniques to achieve this.

```python
thresh = cv2.threshold(enhanced_img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]
```

4. **Segmentation** -  This is where you separate individual characters or words from the image.  You can use connected component analysis or other image segmentation techniques for this. 

It's all about getting the image in the best possible shape for your OCR model.  Just search for "OpenCV image preprocessing" and you'll find tons of examples and tutorials!
