So you're into co-training, huh  pretty cool  especially with different data views  it's like giving your model a bunch of different perspectives on the same problem  makes it smarter  

Here's the basic idea  you train two models on different views of the same data  then you use one model to label data for the other model  and vice versa  like a feedback loop  

Here's a simple example in Python with scikit-learn 

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load your data
# Assuming you have two features: 'view1' and 'view2'
X = data[['view1', 'view2']]
y = data['target']

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create two models
model1 = LogisticRegression()
model2 = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train model1 on 'view1' and model2 on 'view2'
model1.fit(X_train['view1'], y_train)
model2.fit(X_train['view2'], y_train)

# Use model1 to predict labels for 'view2' and vice versa
y_pred_view2 = model1.predict(X_train['view2'])
y_pred_view1 = model2.predict(X_train['view1'])

# Add the predicted labels to the training data
X_train['predicted_view2'] = y_pred_view2
X_train['predicted_view1'] = y_pred_view1

# Train both models again on the augmented data
model1.fit(X_train[['view1', 'predicted_view2']], y_train)
model2.fit(X_train[['view2', 'predicted_view1']], y_train)

# Evaluate the models on the test set
print(model1.score(X_test[['view1', 'predicted_view2']], y_test))
print(model2.score(X_test[['view2', 'predicted_view1']], y_test))
```
