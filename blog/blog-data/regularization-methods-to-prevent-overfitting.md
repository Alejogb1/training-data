Hey, overfitting's a real pain in the neck right? It's when your model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new data  Regularization helps with that  It's like adding a penalty to the model's complexity  The more complex the model, the bigger the penalty 

One popular method is L2 regularization  It adds a penalty proportional to the square of the weights  This encourages smaller weights, which makes the model less sensitive to individual data points  

Here's an example of L2 regularization in Python with scikit-learn 

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

model = Ridge(alpha=0.1)  # alpha controls the strength of the penalty 
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

You can also try L1 regularization  It adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights  This encourages sparsity, meaning some weights become zero  

Search for "L1 regularization scikit-learn" to see how to use it  

Another technique is dropout  It randomly drops out neurons during training  This prevents overreliance on specific neurons and forces the model to learn more robust representations  

Check out "dropout neural network" for more info
