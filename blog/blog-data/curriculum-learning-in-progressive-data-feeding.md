Curriculum learning is pretty cool, it's like training a model step by step  basically you start with easier stuff  then gradually increase the complexity of the data  it's like learning a new language  you start with basic words then move to more complex sentences   

Here's a code snippet  for example  you can use something like PyTorch to implement it   

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# define your model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
# define your optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
# define your loss function
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# define your curriculum
curriculum = [
    # easier data
    (data1, labels1), 
    # more complex data
    (data2, labels2),
    # even more complex data
    (data3, labels3),
]

# train your model
for epoch in range(10):
    for data, labels in curriculum:
        # forward pass
        outputs = model(data)
        # calculate loss
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels)
        # backward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        # update weights
        optimizer.step()
```
