So you're worried about labeling accuracy in your training data, right? Totally get it it's super important for any ML model.  A few things to keep in mind:

- **Quality matters** if your labels are noisy or wrong, your model will learn the wrong patterns.  Think about how to get accurate labels, maybe use a combination of human annotators and automated tools to check their work.
- **Think about the impact** even small errors in your labels can lead to big problems down the line. If you're working on a model for something like medical diagnosis, even a few bad labels can be dangerous.

Here's a snippet that shows how to evaluate label accuracy:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming you have your true labels (y_true) and predicted labels (y_pred)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This uses the scikit-learn library,  you can search for "sklearn accuracy_score" to find the documentation.  Good luck with your model training!
