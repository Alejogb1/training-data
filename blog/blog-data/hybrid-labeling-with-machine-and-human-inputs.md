Hey, that's a really cool concept.  It's like, you know, taking the best of both worlds.  Machines can handle the grunt work, like labeling huge datasets really fast.  But then, humans step in to catch the tricky cases, the ones machines struggle with.  It's all about that collaborative effort.

I've been messing around with this idea, using a Python library called 'Label Studio'.  It's super flexible.  You can create custom interfaces for labeling data, and even have humans in the loop to check machine predictions.  

Here's a quick snippet of how it looks:

```python
from label_studio_ml.model import LabelStudioMLBase

class MyModel(LabelStudioMLBase):
  def predict(self, tasks, **kwargs):
    # ... (your code for machine predictions here)
    for task in tasks:
      # ... (use human feedback to improve predictions)
      # ... (save updated labels)
    return tasks
```

You can search for "Label Studio documentation" to learn more.  It's pretty easy to set up, and there's a ton of examples online.  Plus, it's open source, so it's free to use.  It's a game-changer for labeling large datasets!
