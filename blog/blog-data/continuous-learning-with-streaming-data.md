Yeah, streaming data is super cool and definitely keeps you on your toes.  I've been playing around with Apache Kafka for this kind of stuff, it's a distributed streaming platform that's pretty powerful.  You can set up a pipeline to process data in real-time and build models based on it, which is awesome for things like fraud detection or personalized recommendations.  

Here's a basic example of how you might use it to analyze a stream of user activity data:

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'user_activity', 
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    auto_offset_reset='earliest' 
)

for message in consumer:
    print(message.value.decode('utf-8')) 
```

This code sets up a Kafka consumer to listen for messages on the 'user_activity' topic and then processes each message.  You can build up more complex logic on top of this to analyze the data and make predictions.  There's a ton of other libraries and frameworks out there that work with Kafka, like Spark Streaming, Flink, and Apache Beam.  You can search for "Kafka Python" or "Kafka Stream Processing" to get started!
