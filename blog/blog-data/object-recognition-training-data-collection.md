Hey, so you're trying to train a model to recognize objects, right? That's super cool, but gathering the right training data is key. You'll need a bunch of images of the objects you want your model to learn. Make sure you get good diversity in the data- different angles, lighting conditions, backgrounds, and all that. I'm using a tool called [search term: image annotation tool] that lets me label the objects in my images. You can use this tool to create bounding boxes around the objects in your images which helps the model learn the shape, size, and location of the objects. Once you have your labeled images, you're ready to start training your model. You can use a framework like [search term: object detection library] to do this. Good luck with your project!
