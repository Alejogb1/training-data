Hey, so I've been diving into data preprocessing for EHR records lately  It's a whole different ball game compared to regular data.  First, you gotta deal with the mess  Missing values, inconsistent formats, and those pesky free-text fields  A real pain!  

I've been using Pandas to clean and organize the data It's super helpful for handling missing values  `df.fillna(method='ffill')`  I'm also experimenting with regex to standardize the text fields  `re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)`  

I'm still figuring things out  But I'm learning a lot about feature engineering and handling sensitive data  I'm thinking about checking out some articles on "EHR data preprocessing" and "data anonymization"  Gotta keep learning!
