So you want to preprocess high-resolution images huh  that's cool  I've been messing around with that lately  it's a bit of a challenge with all those pixels  but here's what I've found works pretty well  first you gotta resize the image  you can use OpenCV  it's got a function called `cv2.resize()`  you can use interpolation methods like `cv2.INTER_AREA` for downscaling and `cv2.INTER_CUBIC` for upscaling  then you gotta think about sharpening  a good technique is unsharp masking  you basically blur the image  then subtract that from the original  you can adjust the amount of sharpening by tweaking the kernel size and sigma value  check out `cv2.GaussianBlur()` and `cv2.addWeighted()` for that  and don't forget to normalize the pixel values if you're working with deep learning  it'll make things easier  and if you're dealing with really massive images you might want to look into things like tiled processing  basically divide the image into smaller chunks  process them separately  and then combine them back together  it's a bit more complicated but it can save you some time and memory  hope this helps  happy coding!
