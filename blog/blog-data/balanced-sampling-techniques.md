Hey, so you're looking into balanced sampling techniques huh cool  I've been playing around with that lately too  Especially when working with datasets that have uneven class distributions  It's like you need to make sure your model doesn't just learn the majority class and ignore the others  

One technique I've found helpful is oversampling  Basically, you duplicate samples from the minority class to balance it out  You can do it with Python's `imblearn` library  Here's a code snippet  

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE 
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y) 
``` 

There's also undersampling where you remove samples from the majority class  Or you can even combine both  It's all about finding the right balance for your specific data  

Just search for "imbalanced datasets" and "sampling techniques"  You'll find tons of resources  Good luck with your project!
