Hey, so I've been digging into tagging guidelines for biomedical data lately, and it's a bit of a wild ride. It's crucial to have clear, consistent guidelines for annotating data, especially when dealing with complex medical information. 

Think about it, you don't want your AI model learning the wrong stuff, right? So, I've been researching different approaches and found this neat tool called "brat". It's a popular annotation tool that can help create robust guidelines. 

Here's an example of how to define a tag using "brat" annotation:

```
T1	Protein	32..43	IL-10
```

This defines a tag "Protein" with the text "IL-10" spanning from character 32 to 43 in the document. You can also define relationships between tags using "brat". 

The more detailed your guidelines, the better your model will be.  And don't forget to "search for biomedical text annotation guidelines" for tons of resources. You'll find loads of stuff on different annotation schemes and best practices.
