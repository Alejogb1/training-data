Deduplication is key, man.  Imagine all that wasted space on your drive.  You can use a tool like `rsync` to scan for duplicates and remove them.   It's like having a super-efficient file system.  `rsync` compares files and only copies the changes.  It's a lifesaver when you're dealing with huge amounts of data.  You can also look into `hashing algorithms` to quickly identify duplicates.  These algorithms create unique "fingerprints" for each file, making it easy to spot the same stuff.  Deduplication is definitely a game changer, especially when you're dealing with massive datasets.
