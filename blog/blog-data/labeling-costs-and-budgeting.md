Yeah, labeling costs can really add up. I've been working on a project with tons of data and the labeling was a huge chunk of the budget. I've been using a few things to help manage it. First, I'm breaking down the labeling tasks into smaller chunks and using a tool like "Amazon Mechanical Turk" to get human help with some of the simpler ones. For the more complex stuff, I'm trying out "active learning" which basically helps me train a model to do most of the labeling for me. It's still a work in progress, but I'm hoping to get it working well so I can free up more time and resources for other things. 

Here's a snippet of code for active learning in Python using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into training and unlabeled sets
X_train, X_unlabeled, y_train, y_unlabeled = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5)

# Train a model on the labeled data
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict labels for the unlabeled data
predictions = model.predict(X_unlabeled)

# Select the most uncertain predictions for manual labeling
uncertain_indices = np.argsort(model.predict_proba(X_unlabeled)[:, 1])[::-1]
uncertain_samples = X_unlabeled[uncertain_indices]

# Label the uncertain samples and add them to the training data
```

You can search for "active learning scikit-learn" to find more examples and resources.
