Hey, that's a really cool area! Mixed-signal datasets are key to getting sensor fusion right. Think about it  you've got sensors spitting out all kinds of data  analog, digital, even different frequencies. You need to bring it all together for a clear picture.

One way to do that is with Kalman filters  they're awesome for combining noisy sensor data. 

```python
# Simple Kalman filter example
import numpy as np

# State vector (position, velocity)
x = np.array([0, 0])

# Covariance matrix
P = np.eye(2)

# Measurement matrix
H = np.array([1, 0])

# Measurement noise
R = 0.1

# Process noise
Q = 0.01

# Measurement
z = 1.2

# Kalman filter prediction
x_pred = x
P_pred = P + Q

# Kalman filter update
K = P_pred @ H.T / (H @ P_pred @ H.T + R)
x = x_pred + K @ (z - H @ x_pred)
P = (np.eye(2) - K @ H) @ P_pred

# Print updated state
print(x)
```

Search for  "Kalman filter python"  to learn more. You can also look into "extended Kalman filter"  if you're dealing with non-linear systems. It gets a bit more complicated but definitely powerful.
