Hey, entity disambiguation is super cool! Imagine trying to figure out if "Apple" refers to the fruit, the tech company, or maybe even a person named Apple. That's what entity disambiguation does  it takes a word and figures out which meaning is most likely in a given context. 

Knowledge graphs are amazing for this, they basically store all the information about entities and their relationships.  Think of it like a giant web of connected facts. You can use things like  "entity linking"  to match a word to a specific entity in the graph, using things like  "contextual information"  like nearby words and sentences to figure out the right meaning.

Here's a code snippet showing how to use  "spaCy"  a popular NLP library to do entity disambiguation:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Apple is a tech company, but I like to eat apples.")

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_) 
```

This code will print "Apple" and "apples" along with their labels,  "ORG"  for organization and  "PRODUCT"  for product.
