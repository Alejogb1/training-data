AI ethics in data labeling is a big deal dude  It's about making sure the data used to train AI models is fair and unbiased  This is super important because biased data can lead to biased AI systems  

One way to address this is through **differential privacy**  This technique adds random noise to the data to protect individual privacy while still preserving the overall data patterns  

For example  imagine a dataset with information about people's medical records  Instead of directly using the raw data to train an AI model  we could apply differential privacy to add some random noise to the sensitive information  This would make it harder to identify specific individuals but would still allow the AI model to learn useful patterns from the data  

Here's a basic code snippet to illustrate the concept  

```python  
import numpy as np  

def add_noise(data, epsilon):  
    noise = np.random.laplace(0, 1/epsilon, size=data.shape)  
    return data + noise  

data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  
noisy_data = add_noise(data, 0.5)  

print("Original data:", data)  
print("Noisy data:", noisy_data)  
```

This code adds Laplace noise to a simple dataset using the `add_noise` function  The `epsilon` parameter controls the level of privacy protection  A higher value of `epsilon` means less noise and weaker privacy protection  

By implementing these ethical considerations  we can ensure that AI systems are built on a foundation of fairness and transparency  This is crucial for building trust and responsible AI that benefits everyone
