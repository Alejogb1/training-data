Okay, so you're talking about self-supervised learning with unlabeled data. That's super cool. Basically, you train a model on unlabeled data to learn useful representations. Imagine trying to learn about cats just by looking at tons of pictures without knowing what a cat is.  

Here's a simple example with Python and PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Define your model (e.g., a convolutional neural network)
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    # ... model architecture ...

# Define your data loading pipeline
data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transforms.ToTensor()),
    batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Define your self-supervised loss function (e.g., contrastive loss)
loss_fn = # ... your loss function ...

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_idx, (data, _) in enumerate(data_loader):
        # ... use data to create positive and negative samples ...
        loss = loss_fn(positive_samples, negative_samples)
        # ... update model weights ...
```

You'd have to create your own "loss" function that encourages the model to learn similar features from the unlabeled data.  Think "contrastive learning," "autoencoders," or even "masked language modeling." 

Search "self-supervised learning contrastive loss" for more examples.
