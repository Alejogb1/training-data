So you're trying to train a model to recognize objects, right? That's awesome!  Bounding box annotation is a key part of that.  Think of it like drawing squares around the objects in your images  so the computer knows where to look. You can do this manually with tools like LabelImg, which is a really easy to use GUI  that's pretty standard.  Or you can try using some more advanced techniques, like  'object detection in images using OpenCV' if you want to get fancy.  Once you've got your boxes drawn, you can use them to train your model  using something like  'TensorFlow object detection API' - it's pretty powerful!  

Here's a quick snippet to get you started with labeling using Python:

```python
import cv2

# Load your image
img = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg')

# Define the bounding box coordinates
x, y, w, h = 100, 50, 200, 150

# Draw the rectangle on the image
cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Annotated Image', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows() 
```

This will draw a green rectangle around your object. Now go forth and annotate!
