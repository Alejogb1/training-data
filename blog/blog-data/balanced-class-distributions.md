Okay, so you're talking about balanced class distributions right  that's super important for machine learning models especially if you're dealing with classification problems  otherwise you can end up with a model that's biased towards the majority class  

To handle this you can use techniques like oversampling or undersampling  Oversampling duplicates instances of the minority class to balance the distribution while undersampling removes instances of the majority class  

Here's a quick example of oversampling using the `SMOTE` technique in Python:

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Assuming 'X' is your features and 'y' is your target variable
smote = SMOTE()
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
```

This code snippet uses the `imblearn` library which you can install by searching for "imblearn install python"  it's a powerful tool for dealing with imbalanced datasets  

Also you can explore other techniques like using weighted loss functions or cost-sensitive learning to address this issue
