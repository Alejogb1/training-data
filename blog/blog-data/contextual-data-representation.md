So, you're talking about how to represent data in a way that reflects its context right like, where it came from, what it means, and how it's used.  This is super important because if you just have raw data, it's kinda useless. It's like having a bunch of ingredients but no recipe. 

One way to do this is using metadata, basically adding tags and labels to your data to explain what it is and how it's connected to other things. For example, you could tag a photo with "beach," "sunset," and "California" so you can easily find it later. 

Another cool thing is using ontologies. They're like structured vocabularies that define relationships between things. Think of it like a family tree for your data. You can use ontologies to map out the relationships between concepts and then use those relationships to understand your data better. 

Here's a code snippet that uses JSON-LD to represent data with context:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
  "worksFor": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Acme Corporation"
  }
}
```

This snippet shows how to use the schema.org vocabulary to represent information about a person, including their job title and employer. The "@context" property tells us that the data is using the schema.org vocabulary, and the "@type" property tells us that this is a Person object.

Just remember, context is key for making sense of your data, and there are lots of tools and techniques to help you do it. You can search for "JSON-LD", "schema.org", "RDF", and "ontologies" for more info.
