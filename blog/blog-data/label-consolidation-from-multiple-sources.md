Hey, so you're trying to consolidate labels from different sources huh  That's a common problem  I've tackled it a few times  Here's the basic idea  You need a way to combine the labels  Maybe you use a dictionary or a dataframe  Then you loop through your sources and add the labels  Here's some basic Python code

```python
label_dict = {}
for source in sources:
    for label in source.labels:
        if label not in label_dict:
            label_dict[label] = 0
        label_dict[label] += 1
```

This code will create a dictionary of labels and their counts  You can then use this dictionary to get insights into your labels or to create a consolidated list  You might need to adjust the code depending on how you're storing the labels  Search "Python dictionary merging" or "Python dataframe merging" if you need help with that  Good luck
