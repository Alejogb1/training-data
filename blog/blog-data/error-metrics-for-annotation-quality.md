Hey, so you're looking at error metrics for annotation quality, right? It's super important to know how good your annotations are. There are a bunch of ways to measure it, but it really depends on what you're annotating and why.

For image classification, you could use accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. These are pretty standard and you can easily find them in any machine learning library (like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch). 

Here's a quick snippet of how to calculate accuracy in Python:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

y_true = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

For other tasks, like object detection or natural language processing, you might need different metrics. For object detection, you can use mean average precision (mAP) which considers both localization and classification accuracy. 

For NLP, you can look into things like BLEU score or ROUGE score, depending on your specific task. 

Just remember, the best metric depends on your specific needs.  So make sure you understand what you're measuring and why.
