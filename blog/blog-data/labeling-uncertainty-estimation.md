Hey, so uncertainty estimation is a big deal in machine learning, right  It's all about how confident you are in your predictions. There are a bunch of ways to do it, but one common approach is to use **Bayesian neural networks**  These models learn a probability distribution over the weights, which gives you a measure of uncertainty  

Here's a super simplified code snippet to get you started

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

# Define your model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Use the tfp.layers.DistributionLambda layer to get a distribution over the output
model.add(tfp.layers.DistributionLambda(lambda t: tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=t, scale=0.1)))

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Get the predictive distribution for a new input
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Access the mean and standard deviation of the distribution
mean = predictions.mean()
std = predictions.stddev()
```

The key here is using `tfp.layers.DistributionLambda` to output a probability distribution. It's like saying, "I'm not just predicting one value, I'm predicting a whole range of possibilities." 

You can find tons of resources on **Bayesian deep learning and TensorFlow Probability** to dive deeper. It's a super interesting field! Let me know if you have any other questions.
