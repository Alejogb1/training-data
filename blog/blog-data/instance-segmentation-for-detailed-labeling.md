Hey, instance segmentation is super cool for detailed labeling! It's like object detection but more precise, giving you a bounding box around each individual object.  

To do this, you can use models like Mask R-CNN.  It's awesome because it combines object detection with semantic segmentation. You can check out this code snippet, which shows how to use it with TensorFlow: 

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, UpSampling2D, concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Define the input shape
input_shape = (224, 224, 3)

# Define the backbone network (ResNet50)
backbone = ResNet50(include_top=False, input_shape=input_shape, weights='imagenet')

# ... (Build the Mask R-CNN layers) ...

# Define the final model
model = Model(inputs=backbone.input, outputs=outputs) 

# ... (Train and evaluate the model) ...
```

Mask R-CNN is super popular, and there's a bunch of resources out there about it. Just search for "Mask R-CNN TensorFlow" or "Mask R-CNN PyTorch" to get started.  Good luck!
