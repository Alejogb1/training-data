Hey, that's a great question! Labeled corpora are super important for training NLP models. Basically, you give the model lots of examples of text with the desired output. Like, you could have a corpus of customer reviews labeled with "positive" or "negative" sentiment, or a corpus of news articles labeled with different topics.  The model learns from these examples and eventually can predict the output for new, unseen text. Here's an example of a dataset you could use for sentiment analysis:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews

# Download the movie reviews corpus
nltk.download('movie_reviews')

# Get the data
reviews = movie_reviews.fileids()

# Create a list of labeled data
data = []
for review in reviews:
  category = review.split('/')[-1]
  text = movie_reviews.raw(review)
  data.append((text, category))

print(data[0])
```

This code snippet uses the `nltk.corpus.movie_reviews` dataset which includes labeled movie reviews. You could use this to train a model that predicts whether a movie review is positive or negative. This is just one example, but there are tons of other labeled corpora out there. You can search for them using keywords like "**labeled datasets for sentiment analysis**", "**labeled datasets for text classification**", or "**labeled corpora for natural language processing**".  You can also find specialized datasets for specific tasks like named entity recognition or machine translation. Just search for those specific tasks with the word "**dataset**" or "**corpus**" to get started!
