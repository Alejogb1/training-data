So you're trying to organize stuff with multiple levels of categories, right?  Like, you want to be able to have "Food" then "Fruits" then "Apples" and "Bananas" under that.  Think of it like a tree structure  Here's a simple way to represent that using JSON 

```json
{
  "Food": {
    "Fruits": {
      "Apples": [],
      "Bananas": []
    },
    "Vegetables": {
      "Carrots": [],
      "Spinach": []
    }
  }
}
```

This is a nested object  Each key is a category and the value is either an array of items or another object for subcategories  You can keep nesting as deep as you need.  

This is a common pattern in web development  Search for "hierarchical data structures" or "tree data structures"  There are libraries and tools to make working with this kind of data easier.
