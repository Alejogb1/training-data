Hey, data redundancy is a big pain right? It takes up space, makes things slow, and is just messy. One way to deal with it is normalization. Normalization breaks your data down into smaller, more manageable tables with less duplication. 

Think of it like this, imagine you have a table with customer info and their orders. Instead of storing the customer address in every order, you create a separate table for customers with their info and then just link the order table to the customer table using an ID. 

Here's a quick SQL example of how this works:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerName VARCHAR(255),
  CustomerAddress VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerID INT,
  OrderDate DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

You can search for "database normalization" to learn more about the different types and how to apply them to your data.
