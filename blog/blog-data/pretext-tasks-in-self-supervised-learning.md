Okay, so pretext tasks are like giving your model a little puzzle to solve before it gets to the real stuff.  It's all about teaching the model to understand data without labels.  Think of it like learning to recognize a cat without anyone telling you what a cat is. 

There are tons of different pretext tasks out there, but here's a simple one you could try: 

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyPretextModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    # ... your model architecture here ...

  def forward(self, x):
    # ... your model processing here ...
    return x

model = MyPretextModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
  for batch in data_loader:
    # ... get your data ...

    # randomly mask out some of the pixels in the image
    masked_image = apply_mask(image) 

    # pass the masked image through the model
    output = model(masked_image)

    # predict the missing pixels
    predicted_pixels = output  

    # calculate the loss
    loss = loss_fn(predicted_pixels, image)

    # optimize the model
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

You can search for "image inpainting" to see how to reconstruct missing pixels in an image, or "masked autoregression" for more advanced techniques. The idea is to give the model a task that requires it to learn the underlying structure of the data. Once it's learned that, you can fine-tune it on your labeled data for the actual task.
