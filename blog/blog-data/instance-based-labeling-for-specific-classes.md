Hey, that's pretty cool! I've been playing around with instance-based labeling for my image classification project. It's basically like saying "hey, look at these specific examples, and classify everything else based on those."  

Here's a simple example using scikit-learn: 

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# create your dataset -  load your images and labels
# ...

# Train a KNN classifier using the instance-based labels
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5) 
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = knn.predict(X_test)
```

Basically, KNeighborsClassifier will predict the label of a new instance based on the labels of its k nearest neighbors in the training set.  You can adjust the number of neighbors (n_neighbors) to control how many neighbors influence the prediction. 

This approach is super useful when you don't have a ton of labeled data. You can use it to manually label a few key instances and then let the model generalize to new examples. 

Just remember, if you're working with images you might want to preprocess them first. Search for "image preprocessing for KNN" and you'll find tons of resources on how to scale, normalize, and extract features from your images.
