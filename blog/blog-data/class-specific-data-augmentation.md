Hey, that's a cool concept!  Class-specific data augmentation is super useful when you're dealing with datasets that have imbalanced classes. Imagine you're training a model to identify different types of birds  you'll have way more pictures of common birds than rare ones.  To balance things out, you can use techniques like:

- **Over-sampling:**  Duplicate examples from the under-represented classes.
- **Under-sampling:**  Remove examples from the over-represented classes.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:**  Create new, realistic examples of the under-represented classes.

Here's a snippet for generating synthetic images using **image augmentation**  with **Albumentations** (search: "Albumentations Python"):

```python
import albumentations as A
from albumentations.pytorch import ToTensorV2

# Define augmentation pipeline for each class
class_augmentations = {
    "rare_bird": A.Compose([
        A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.5), 
        A.Rotate(limit=15, p=0.5),
        A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        ToTensorV2()
    ]),
    "common_bird": A.Compose([
        A.RandomCrop(width=224, height=224),
        ToTensorV2()
    ])
}

# Apply augmentation during training
for image, label in training_data:
    if label == "rare_bird":
        augmented_image = class_augmentations["rare_bird"](image=image)["image"]
    else:
        augmented_image = class_augmentations["common_bird"](image=image)["image"]
    # ... train the model using augmented_image ...
```

This code snippet shows how you can use Albumentations to apply different augmentations to images based on their class label.  This way you create more "rare bird" images, giving your model more chances to learn about them.  It's all about balancing the training set to get better results!
