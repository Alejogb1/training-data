Hey, so you're trying to deal with errors in OCR datasets that's a super common problem. I've been working on a project with some image data and ran into the same thing.  Turns out there are a bunch of cool techniques to tackle this.  

One thing I've been experimenting with is using a **"Levenshtein distance"** to calculate the difference between the predicted text and the ground truth. You can find Python libraries like "**fuzzywuzzy**" that implement it.  It's basically a measure of how many edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) you need to make to turn one string into another.

```python
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

predicted_text = "This is a test"
ground_truth = "This is a test"

levenshtein_distance = fuzz.ratio(predicted_text, ground_truth)
print(levenshtein_distance) # Output: 100
```

There are also more advanced approaches like **"word embedding"** and **"language models"** that can help with error correction.  I'm not gonna lie, it gets a bit more complicated, but there are tons of resources out there like **"BERT"** and **"Word2Vec"** if you wanna dive in.
