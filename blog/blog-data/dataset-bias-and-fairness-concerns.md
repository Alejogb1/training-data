Yo, so dataset bias is a HUGE deal in ML. Basically, if your training data doesn't represent the real world well, your model will be biased. Imagine training a facial recognition system on mostly white faces and then expecting it to work well on people of color - not gonna happen.

The key is to make sure your data is diverse and representative. You can try using techniques like **oversampling** or **undersampling** to balance out your dataset.

Here's a quick code snippet to illustrate oversampling:

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

X_resampled, y_resampled = SMOTE().fit_resample(X, y)
```

You can find more info on **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) by searching for **"SMOTE oversampling"** online.

Fairness is another biggie. You need to make sure your model doesn't discriminate against certain groups. This requires careful consideration of your data and model design. For instance, using **fairness metrics** like **equalized odds** can help you assess your model's fairness. Search for **"fairness metrics machine learning"** for more details.

Remember, building fair and unbiased models is a continuous process. Keep learning, keep experimenting, and keep pushing for a more equitable AI world. ðŸ’ª
