Hey, so you're dealing with data imbalance, huh  That's a common problem in machine learning, especially when you're trying to build a model that can predict rare events.  Think of it like trying to teach a robot to recognize a cat in a sea of dogs. If you only show it a few cat pictures, it'll get confused and probably think everything is a dog. 

To combat this, you gotta try some techniques like oversampling or undersampling. Oversampling basically duplicates your rare data points, while undersampling removes some of the more common ones.  You can also use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), which creates synthetic data points that resemble your rare class. 

Here's a simple example using Python's imblearn library  It shows how to oversample your minority class with SMOTE. 

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Create an imbalanced dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)

# Oversample the minority class using SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
```

By using these techniques, you can help your model learn from a more balanced dataset, leading to better predictions and a happier robot.  Just remember to search for "imbalanced data handling techniques" and experiment with different methods to find what works best for your specific problem.
