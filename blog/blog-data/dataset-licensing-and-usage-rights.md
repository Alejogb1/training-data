Hey, that's a super important topic  data licensing and usage rights are a real pain sometimes  especially when you're working with large datasets  I've run into this a bunch with public datasets   sometimes they're open use  sometimes they're super restrictive  you gotta be careful  

Here's a snippet from a Python script that might help  it checks the license of a dataset  

```python
import requests
import json

def get_license(dataset_url):
  response = requests.get(dataset_url)
  if response.status_code == 200:
    data = json.loads(response.text)
    if 'license' in data:
      return data['license']
    else:
      return 'License not found'
  else:
    return 'Error fetching dataset'

# Example usage
license = get_license('https://example.com/dataset.json')
print(license)
```

This is just a basic example  but it should get you started  you can find more info about dataset licensing by searching for  "dataset licensing"  "data usage rights"  and "open data licenses"  on the web  Make sure you understand the terms and conditions before using any dataset  you don't wanna get in trouble   It's a lot easier to be safe than sorry
