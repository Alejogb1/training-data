Hey, normalization is super important for time-series data, especially when you're comparing different datasets or features.  Think of it as putting everything on the same scale, so you can actually see the patterns. One popular method is min-max scaling. It basically squishes your data between 0 and 1, making everything relative. Here's a quick code example using Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample time-series data
data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Min-max scaling
normalized_data = (data - np.min(data)) / (np.max(data) - np.min(data))

print(normalized_data)
```

This will print out the normalized values. Super simple, right? You can also check out other techniques like standardization or z-score normalization, which are helpful for dealing with outliers.  Just search for "time series data normalization techniques" on Google or a similar search engine.
