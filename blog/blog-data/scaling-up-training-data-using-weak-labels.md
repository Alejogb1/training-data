Hey, scaling up training data with weak labels is a super common thing to do, especially when you're working with massive datasets.  Basically, you're using data that isn't perfectly labeled, but it's still valuable. Think of it like this: you're throwing a wide net to catch more data, even if some of it isn't perfect.  

Here's a basic code snippet using PyTorch that can get you started.  Keep in mind, this is just a starting point and there are tons of different ways to implement this, so you can tailor it to your needs.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define your model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Create a weak label dataset
weak_labels = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

# Create a loss function that uses weak labels
loss_fn = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

# Train the model using weak labels
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
for epoch in range(10):
  for i, data in enumerate(weak_labels):
    # Forward pass
    output = model(data)
    # Calculate loss
    loss = loss_fn(output, data)
    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

So yeah, you can search for "weak supervision in deep learning", "semi-supervised learning with noisy labels", or "data augmentation with weak labels". You'll find tons of resources on this.  Just remember to experiment with different approaches and see what works best for your specific problem!
