Adversarial robustness in data collection is super important, especially when dealing with machine learning models. It’s about making your data collection process resistant to attacks that could manipulate or poison your dataset. 

Think about it like this, imagine you’re training a model to recognize cats, and someone feeds it tons of images of dogs labeled as cats. This will mess up the model's learning process.

One way to deal with this is using **adversarial training**. It involves adding tiny, almost imperceptible changes (like **"noise"** or **"perturbations"**) to your data to make it harder for the model to be fooled. This forces the model to learn more robust features and become less susceptible to manipulation.

Here's a basic example of adding noise to an image using the **"salt and pepper"** method in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from skimage.util import random_noise

image = np.array(image)  # Your input image
noisy_image = random_noise(image, mode="s&p", amount=0.1)  # Add 10% noise
```

You can also use **"data augmentation"**, which involves creating variations of your existing data, like rotating or scaling images, to help your model generalize better and become more resistant to adversarial attacks.

Remember, a strong data collection strategy is key to building robust machine learning models, so don't forget about adversarial robustness! It's a crucial part of creating AI systems that can handle real-world complexities.
