Okay, so quality control in labeled datasets is a big deal, right  it's like the foundation of any machine learning project  if your data is bad your model will be bad  

There are a bunch of things you can do to check the quality of your labels 

One thing you can do is to use a script to check for common errors like missing labels, inconsistent labels, or labels that are just plain wrong  Here's a basic example of how you could do that in Python

```python
import pandas as pd

def check_labels(df):
  """
  Checks for common errors in a labeled dataset.

  Args:
    df: A pandas DataFrame containing the labeled dataset.

  Returns:
    A list of errors found in the dataset.
  """

  errors = []
  if df.isnull().values.any():
    errors.append("Missing labels found")
  if df.duplicated().any():
    errors.append("Duplicate labels found")
  if df['label'].nunique() < 2:
    errors.append("Less than two unique labels found")

  return errors

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Check for errors
errors = check_labels(df)

# Print the errors
if errors:
  print("Errors found:")
  for error in errors:
    print(f"- {error}")
else:
  print("No errors found")
```

Another thing you can do is to visually inspect your data, you can do that using a visualization library like Matplotlib  You can create histograms, scatter plots, or box plots to see if there are any patterns or outliers in your data  

You can also use tools like data validation and data annotation to improve the quality of your labels  

I hope this helps  Let me know if you have any questions
