Hey so I've been digging into instance reweighting for dealing with underrepresented data in my models. It's basically giving more weight to the data points that are less common.  One cool technique I've found is using something called "inverse frequency weighting" where you calculate the inverse of the frequency of each class and use that as the weight. 

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume data is in a pandas DataFrame called 'df'
# With a column named 'target_variable'
class_weights = df['target_variable'].value_counts().apply(lambda x: 1/x)
df['weights'] = df['target_variable'].map(class_weights)
```

This code snippet basically counts how many times each class appears in your data, then calculates the inverse of that count. This way, the rarer classes get a higher weight.  You can then use these weights when training your model. 

There's a lot more you can do with instance reweighting, like using different weighting strategies and even adjusting weights dynamically during training.  I'm definitely going to keep exploring these techniques to make my models more robust and handle imbalanced datasets better.
