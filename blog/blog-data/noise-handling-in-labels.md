Hey, noise in labels is a pain right?  It can mess up your model's learning. There are a few things you can do about it.

First, you can try data augmentation techniques to create more robust labels. This can involve adding random noise to the labels themselves or generating synthetic labels. 

Then, you can use regularization techniques during training to prevent overfitting. This can include L1 or L2 regularization. 

And lastly, you can try to use a more robust loss function. Instead of using mean squared error, you can use something like Huber loss or smooth L1 loss.

Here's an example of how to implement L2 regularization in TensorFlow:

```python
# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  # ...
])

# Add L2 regularization to the weights
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse',
              metrics=['accuracy'],
              loss_weights=1e-4)
```
