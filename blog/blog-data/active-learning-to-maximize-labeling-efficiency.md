Active learning is basically like teaching your AI model to be a smart learner It picks the data it needs to learn from  and you don't have to label everything  Imagine you're training a dog  You wouldn't show it every single type of ball to learn what a ball is  You'd show it a few key examples and then let it figure out the rest  That's active learning in a nutshell 

Here's how it works  You give the model some labeled data and it tries to classify unlabeled data  It then asks you to label the ones it's unsure about  This way you're only labeling the most helpful data  

Here's a snippet of how it might look in code:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load data and split into labeled and unlabeled sets
X_labeled, y_labeled, X_unlabeled = load_data()

# Train a model on the labeled data
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_labeled, y_labeled)

# Predict labels for the unlabeled data
predictions = model.predict(X_unlabeled)

# Identify the most uncertain predictions and ask for human labeling
uncertain_indices = get_uncertain_indices(predictions)
X_to_label = X_unlabeled[uncertain_indices]
```

You can search for "active learning algorithms" and "active learning query strategies" to learn more about different approaches and techniques  It's a pretty cool way to make your AI models smarter and more efficient
