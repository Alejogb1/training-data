Okay, so you're looking into semi-supervised learning frameworks huh  that's a pretty hot topic these days  I've been playing around with a few myself  one that I really like is  **[framework name]**  it's super easy to use  you can just throw in a bunch of unlabeled data along with your labeled data and it'll learn to classify it all  here's a snippet of how you can use it:

```python
from [framework name] import [model class]
model = [model class]()
model.fit(unlabeled_data, labeled_data)
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

You can find a ton of information on semi-supervised learning frameworks by searching for "[framework name] documentation" on  **[search engine]**  There's also a ton of research papers on the topic  just search for "semi-supervised learning frameworks" on  **[academic search engine]**  it's a really cool area to explore  I've learned a lot from it myself.
