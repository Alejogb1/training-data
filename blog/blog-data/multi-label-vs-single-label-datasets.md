Hey, so you're thinking about multi-label datasets versus single-label ones, huh  This is pretty cool stuff  The main difference is how many classes a single data point can belong to.  Single-label means each example has only *one* label, like a picture of a cat being labeled 'cat'.   But with multi-label, one image could have multiple tags like 'cat', 'fluffy', and 'sleeping'.  

This changes things in how you build your models, you gotta use algorithms designed for multi-label tasks like 'multi-label classification'  Think of it like this:  

```python
# Single-label data
labels = ['cat', 'dog', 'bird']
# Multi-label data
labels = [['cat', 'fluffy'], ['dog', 'brown'], ['bird', 'flying']]
```

You might want to use different loss functions, like 'binary cross-entropy' instead of 'categorical cross-entropy'  And  'precision', 'recall', and 'F1 score' are metrics to look into for evaluating multi-label performance.  Definitely check out 'multi-label classification' in your favorite ML library  Good luck
