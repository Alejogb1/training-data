Hey, so I've been playing around with class-specific augmentations lately and it's pretty cool  I'm using a technique called "Mixup" where you basically blend images from different classes  It helps the model learn to distinguish between classes better  Here's a snippet of how I'm implementing it

```python
def mixup(image1, image2, label1, label2, alpha):
    lambda_ = np.random.beta(alpha, alpha)
    mixed_image = lambda_ * image1 + (1 - lambda_) * image2
    mixed_label = lambda_ * label1 + (1 - lambda_) * label2
    return mixed_image, mixed_label
```

I'm using a beta distribution to generate the lambda value which controls the blending ratio  I've been reading a lot about "mixup" and "cutmix" recently they're both pretty popular for image classification tasks  You should definitely check out some papers on these techniques  They're super helpful for boosting performance on datasets with a lot of classes  Good luck with your projects  Let me know if you have any questions!
