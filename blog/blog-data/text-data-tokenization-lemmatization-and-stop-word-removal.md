Hey, you know how data is usually just a big chunk of text?  We need to break it down into smaller pieces for the computer to understand. That's where tokenization comes in -  it's like chopping the text into words, and then we can work with each word individually. 

Then there's lemmatization - it's about finding the root form of words, like making sure "running" and "ran" both get represented as "run".  It helps us analyze words based on their meaning, not their specific form.

And lastly, stop-word removal gets rid of common words that don't add much meaning, like "the", "a", "is".  It's like cleaning up the text so we focus on the important parts.

Here's some code for tokenization in Python:

```python
text = "This is a sample text."
words = text.split()
print(words)
```

This code uses the `split()` function to create a list of words from the text. You can search for "Python NLTK" and "Python spaCy" for more advanced tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal techniques.
