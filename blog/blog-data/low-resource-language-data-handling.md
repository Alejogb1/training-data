Hey, that's a really interesting problem low-resource language data is tough! It's like trying to build a house with only a few bricks. You have to get creative to make the most of what you have. One thing I've been playing around with is **data augmentation** using things like **back translation** and **synonym replacement** it's super helpful for expanding your dataset. Here's a snippet I've been working on to do some back translation with Google Translate:

```python
from googletrans import Translator

def back_translate(text, source_lang, target_lang):
  translator = Translator()
  translated = translator.translate(text, src=source_lang, dest=target_lang)
  back_translated = translator.translate(translated.text, src=target_lang, dest=source_lang)
  return back_translated.text
```

You can use this function to translate your text to another language and then back to the original, generating new variations of your data.  You can also explore techniques like **zero-shot learning** and **cross-lingual transfer learning** these are really cool ways to leverage knowledge from high-resource languages to improve performance on low-resource ones.  I'm still learning a lot about this stuff though, so definitely check out some papers and tutorials on **low-resource language processing** and **data augmentation techniques** for more info!
