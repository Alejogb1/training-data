Okay, so manual labeling is like, you know, doing everything by hand  it's tedious  takes forever  especially for large datasets  automated tools are the way to go  they use algorithms to do the labeling  saves tons of time  and usually more accurate  take a look at this code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load your data
data = load_data()

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['features'], data['labels'], test_size=0.2)

# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

This code uses a popular machine learning library called scikit-learn (search "scikit-learn library")  it shows how to split your data into training and testing sets  train a model  and then calculate its accuracy  pretty cool huh?
