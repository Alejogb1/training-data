Hey so yeah, outlier detection in labeled datasets is super important right? Especially if you're trying to build a model that's gonna generalize well. 

There's a bunch of different ways to do it, but one of my favs is using **Isolation Forest**. It's based on this idea of isolating anomalies by randomly partitioning data, basically building trees that try to isolate these outliers. 

Here's a little Python code snippet to get you started: 
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Create the model 
model = IsolationForest()

# Fit the model to your labeled dataset
model.fit(X_train)

# Predict outlier scores for new data
outlier_scores = model.decision_function(X_test)
```

You can check the docs for **sklearn IsolationForest** to learn more about how to customize it. 

Another cool technique is using **one-class SVM** which focuses on finding a boundary around your "normal" data points, and anything outside is considered an outlier. You can use the **sklearn OneClassSVM** library for that. 

Definitely worth exploring these options to make sure your model is handling those pesky outliers!
