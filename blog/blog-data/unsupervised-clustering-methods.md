Hey, so you're looking into unsupervised clustering methods  that's a really cool area of machine learning  it's all about finding patterns in data without any labels  like  you're basically letting the algorithm figure out the groups on its own  right  

One popular method is k-means clustering  it's pretty straightforward  you specify the number of clusters you want  and the algorithm assigns each data point to the closest cluster centroid  

Here's a simple example using Python and the scikit-learn library  

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample data
data = np.array([[1, 2], [1.5, 1.8], [5, 8], [8, 8], [1, 0.6], [9, 11]])

# Create a k-means object with 2 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)

# Fit the data to the model
kmeans.fit(data)

# Get the cluster labels for each data point
labels = kmeans.labels_
```

You can visualize the clusters using a scatter plot  just color-code the points based on the cluster labels  

There are also other methods like hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN which have different strengths and weaknesses  you can search for "clustering algorithms comparison" to learn more about them  

Let me know if you want to explore specific algorithms or have any questions  I'm happy to help
