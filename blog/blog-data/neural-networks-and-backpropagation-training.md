Neural networks are like brains, they learn from data. Backpropagation is the way we teach them. Imagine a bunch of interconnected neurons, each with a weight. We feed data in, calculate the output, and see how far off it is from the right answer. Backpropagation then adjusts the weights to reduce the error. It's like tweaking the connections in a brain to make it better at a task.

Here's a simplified example in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the activation function
def sigmoid(x):
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Define the neural network structure
input_layer_size = 2
hidden_layer_size = 3
output_layer_size = 1

# Initialize weights randomly
weights_1 = np.random.randn(input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size)
weights_2 = np.random.randn(hidden_layer_size, output_layer_size)

# Example data
inputs = np.array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]])
targets = np.array([[0.5], [0.6]])

# Forward propagation
hidden_output = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, weights_1))
output = sigmoid(np.dot(hidden_output, weights_2))

# Calculate error
error = targets - output

# Backpropagation (adjusting weights)
# This is simplified, actual backpropagation is more complex
weights_2 += np.dot(hidden_output.T, error) * 0.1
weights_1 += np.dot(inputs.T, np.dot(error, weights_2.T) * sigmoid(hidden_output) * (1 - sigmoid(hidden_output))) * 0.1

# Repeat training with more data
```

The `sigmoid` function is used to activate neurons. You can search for "activation functions neural networks" to learn more. The code shows basic weight adjustments. Real backpropagation involves calculating gradients and using optimizers like gradient descent, which you can search for as well.
