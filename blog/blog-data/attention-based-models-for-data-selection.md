Hey, so you're into attention-based models for data selection, huh That's pretty cool!  I've been playing around with them lately, especially for stuff like filtering out irrelevant data. It's kinda like giving your model a superpower to focus on the most important bits.

For example, you can use a transformer network with an attention mechanism to prioritize certain features or aspects of your data. The model essentially learns to "pay attention" to the parts that are most relevant to the task at hand.

Here's a basic code snippet to get you started:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class AttentionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(AttentionModel, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_dim, num_heads=8)
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, input_data):
        # Encode the input data
        encoder_outputs, _ = self.encoder(input_data)

        # Calculate attention weights
        attention_weights = self.attention(encoder_outputs, encoder_outputs, encoder_outputs)[0]

        # Apply attention weights to encoder outputs
        context_vector = torch.sum(attention_weights * encoder_outputs, dim=1)

        # Decode the context vector
        output = self.decoder(context_vector)

        return output
```

You'll want to search for "transformer network" and "multihead attention" to get a better grasp of these components.  It's a really exciting field, so let me know if you have any other questions about this stuff!
