Hybrid data labeling is super cool!  It's like combining the best of both worlds -  human intelligence and machine learning. Basically, you use humans to label some data, then train a model on that data. This model can then help label more data, and so on. 

It's a great way to get around the problem of having tons of unlabeled data.  And it can help you build better models faster.  Here's a simple example:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load your labeled data
X_train, y_train = load_labeled_data()

# Train your model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use your model to predict labels for unlabeled data
X_unlabeled = load_unlabeled_data()
y_predicted = model.predict(X_unlabeled)

# Use the predicted labels to train your model further
X_train = np.concatenate((X_train, X_unlabeled))
y_train = np.concatenate((y_train, y_predicted))

# Re-train your model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate your model
X_test, y_test = load_test_data()
y_predicted = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_predicted)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

You can search for  "active learning" and "weak supervision" for more info.  The key is to find a balance between human labeling and machine learning.
