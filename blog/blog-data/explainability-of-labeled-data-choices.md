Hey, explaining labeled data choices is kinda like explaining your code to someone who doesn't know what's going on. You need to break it down. 

First, you gotta define your labels.  What are the categories you're trying to identify? This is like your "if" statements in code.  Then, you gotta figure out how to represent these categories in your data. This is where things get interesting. 

Imagine you're building a model to identify cats and dogs. You could use a simple binary label -  0 for cat, 1 for dog. Or you could get more specific and use multiple labels, like "cat breed", "dog breed", "age", "size" etc. 

This is all about choosing the right data representation for your model. It's like using the right data types in your code. If you use the wrong ones, your model might not work as well.

```python
# Example of labels for a cat/dog image classification model
labels = {
  0: "cat",
  1: "dog"
}
```

To get more technical, you can look up "data representation" and "feature engineering" online.  It's all about making sure your data is in the right format for your model to learn from it.
