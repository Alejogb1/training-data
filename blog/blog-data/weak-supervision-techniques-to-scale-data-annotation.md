So you're looking to scale data annotation  that's a real pain point  especially with limited resources  weak supervision is your best friend  it basically lets you use unlabeled data  which is usually a ton  and a few labeled examples to train your model  pretty cool right  

Think of it like this  imagine you want to train a model to classify images of cats  you could spend ages manually labeling thousands of images  but with weak supervision you could use a bunch of unlabeled images  and just tell the model  "hey  this image has a cat in it"  or "this image doesn't have a cat"  and the model will learn from that  

One common technique is  **label propagation**  it's basically like a game of telephone  you start with a few labeled examples and then use them to predict the labels of unlabeled examples  and then you use those predictions to predict even more labels  and so on  

Here's a quick code snippet to get you started  

```python
from sklearn.semi_supervised import LabelPropagation

# Initialize the LabelPropagation model
model = LabelPropagation()

# Train the model on the labeled data
model.fit(X_labeled, y_labeled)

# Predict labels for unlabeled data
y_predicted = model.predict(X_unlabeled)
```

This is just a basic example  there are tons of other techniques  like **distant supervision**  **multi-instance learning**  and **weakly supervised learning**  you can search those terms on Google for more info  

Anyway  weak supervision is a powerful tool for scaling data annotation  it's definitely worth checking out!
