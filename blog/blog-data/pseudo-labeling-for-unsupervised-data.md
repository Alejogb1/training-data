So you wanna label your data without actually labeling it huh  Interesting  Pseudo-labeling's the way to go  Basically you train a model on your unlabeled data and then use that model to generate pseudo-labels for the data  The model then trains again using these labels  It's like bootstrapping yourself out of the unlabeled data problem 

Here's a basic example in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Define your model and dataset here

# Train initial model on unlabeled data
model = Model()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
for epoch in range(epochs):
  for batch in dataloader:
    # ... your training logic ...
# Generate pseudo-labels
pseudo_labels = model(unlabeled_data)
# Use pseudo-labels to retrain model
# ... your retraining logic ...

```

There's a lot more to it than that though  You gotta be careful about confidence scores, consistency checks and  you might even want to use a teacher-student approach  Search "pseudo-labeling techniques" and "confidence-based pseudo-labeling" for more info
