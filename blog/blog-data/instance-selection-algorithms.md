Instance selection algorithms are super useful for dealing with massive datasets. They basically pick out the most relevant instances to train your model, which is awesome for reducing computational costs and preventing overfitting. 

One popular technique is called **k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)**. It finds the k closest instances to a new instance based on some distance metric. This helps in classifying the new instance based on the majority class of its neighbors.

Here's a basic Python snippet for k-NN:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
```

Other algorithms like **condensed nearest neighbor (CNN)** and **edited nearest neighbor (ENN)** focus on removing noisy or redundant instances, leading to a cleaner dataset. 

You can find more info on these algorithms by searching for "instance selection algorithms," "k-nearest neighbors," "condensed nearest neighbor," and "edited nearest neighbor" on your favorite search engine.
