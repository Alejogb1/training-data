Hey, so co-reference resolution is basically figuring out which words in a text refer to the same thing. Like, if you see "John went to the store. He bought milk" you gotta know that "He" refers to "John" right?  That's what co-reference resolution does.  It's a big deal in NLP because it helps make sense of the relationships between words in a text. 

One way to do it is with something called "coreference chains" which use things like pronouns and noun phrases to identify the connections. 

Let me show you a quick example using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("John went to the store. He bought milk.")

for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.dep_, token.head.text, token.head.dep_) 
```

You'll see that each token's dependency relation is shown, including "He" being linked back to "John" as the head.

This is just one example, there are a lot of other approaches too.  Check out "co-reference resolution techniques" and "neural co-reference resolution models" to learn more. You can also explore different libraries like AllenNLP or Hugging Face for more advanced models.
