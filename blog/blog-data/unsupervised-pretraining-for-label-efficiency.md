Hey, so you're talking about unsupervised pretraining for label efficiency right  that's totally a thing, and it's super cool  basically, you train your model on a massive amount of unlabeled data  think of it as letting your model learn the structure of the language or the underlying patterns in the data  this way, when you actually do have labeled data  you can use it to fine-tune the model  and it learns much faster  

Here's a quick example of how to do this with a BERT model  you'd first pretrain it on a huge dataset of text like Wikipedia  and then you can use that pretrained model on your specific task  like sentiment analysis  

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import torch 

# load pretrained BERT model
model = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# tokenize your data
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# get the embeddings from the pretrained model
embeddings = model(**inputs).last_hidden_state
```

This is just a tiny taste of what's possible  you can use unsupervised pretraining on all sorts of data  and it's a really powerful tool to make your models learn faster  just remember to search for "unsupervised pretraining" and "transfer learning" to get the full picture  it's worth diving into, trust me.
