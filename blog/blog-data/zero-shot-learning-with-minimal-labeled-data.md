Yeah, zero-shot learning is pretty cool, especially when you're dealing with limited data. Basically, you train a model on a bunch of labeled data, and then it can classify new data that it's never seen before. The trick is that you need to give it some kind of description of the new data, like text or attributes.

Here's a simple example using Python and a library called `sklearn`. 

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Create a vectorizer to extract features from text
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Train the model on some labeled data
X_train = ["This is a cat", "The dog is running", "The bird is flying"]
y_train = ["cat", "dog", "bird"]
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the class of new data
X_test = ["I saw a furry animal with four legs"]
X_test = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
prediction = model.predict(X_test)

print(prediction) # Output: ["dog"]
```

So, in this case, the model has never seen the phrase "furry animal with four legs" before, but because it's been trained on a set of animal descriptions, it can use the information it's learned to make a prediction.

You can find more info about zero-shot learning and `sklearn` by searching "zero-shot learning sklearn". There are also other libraries and techniques you can use for this type of learning, like `transformers` for NLP tasks or `CLIP` for image-text tasks.
