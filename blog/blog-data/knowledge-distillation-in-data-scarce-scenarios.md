Hey, that's a super interesting topic. Knowledge distillation is super useful when you're dealing with small datasets. Basically, you take a big, powerful model (the "teacher") that's already been trained on a huge dataset and use it to teach a smaller model (the "student").  

Think of it like this, imagine you have a super detailed textbook (the teacher model) and you want to create a more concise study guide (the student model)  that captures the most important info. The student model learns from the teacher model's predictions and tries to mimic them.

Here's a code snippet to get you started  
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Load the teacher model
teacher_model =  # your teacher model

# Create the student model
student_model = Sequential()
student_model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,))) 
student_model.add(Dense(output_shape))

# Compile and train the student model using the teacher's predictions
student_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
student_model.fit(x_train, teacher_model.predict(x_train), epochs=10)

# Now you have a smaller, more efficient model that can handle your data-scarce scenarios!
``` 

To learn more, search for "knowledge distillation" and "student-teacher model"  There's a lot of research on this, especially for image classification and natural language processing, but it can be applied to tons of different machine learning tasks.
