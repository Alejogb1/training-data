Hey, jargon's a real pain, right?  Especially when you're trying to build something that everyone can understand.  I've been wrestling with this lately, and I found a really cool way to handle it using regular expressions.  You know, those crazy patterns you can use to match text?  Check this out:

```python
import re
text = "I'm going to the store to buy a new SSD for my laptop"
jargon = re.findall(r'\b(SSD|laptop)\b', text) 
print(jargon)
```

This snippet finds words like "SSD" and "laptop" within the text using a regex pattern.  You could even create a dictionary to map these words to their definitions, so you could provide explanations or translations!  Just search for "python regex dictionary" and "python regular expression glossary" to see some cool examples.  It's all about making your code more accessible, you know?
