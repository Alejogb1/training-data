Batch normalization is basically a way to help your neural network learn faster and more stably. Imagine your network is trying to learn a really complex function, but the inputs are all over the place. Batch normalization kinda squishes those inputs into a nice, consistent range. This helps the network focus on learning the actual relationship between the inputs and outputs, without getting distracted by crazy variations. 

Here's a super simplified code snippet to give you a feel for it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# define your layer
layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')

# add batch normalization
layer = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(layer)
```

So, what's happening here? We're essentially adding a layer that normalizes the output of the previous layer (the Dense layer in this case). It's like giving the network a little "clean up crew" to make sure the data is nice and tidy before it moves on.  

This is a super basic explanation.  Search for "batch normalization tensorflow" or "batch normalization pytorch" to dive deeper into the details and see how it's used in real-world implementations. You'll find a ton of info on how it's used for different architectures and its impact on training speed and performance.
